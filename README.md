# recipe-app-backend

This repository includes back-end code of my recipe app.

## Why?

I'm creating this project to summarize my knowledge, what I've learned for the past 6 months ;)

## The front-end part

Frontend made in Vue.js, link -> [# recipe-app-frontend](https://github.com/danielbukowski/recipe-app-frontend)
